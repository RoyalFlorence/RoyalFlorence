Hi, I am @RoyalFlorence.

I graduated in physics in august 2021 and I am currently teaching high school chemistry, but I would like to do a PhD position.
I found out quickly that many PhD positions require some level of coding and so the idea of this account is that I can place and show my collection of coding trinkets.
